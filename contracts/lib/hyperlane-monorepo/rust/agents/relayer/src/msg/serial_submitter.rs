/// SerialSubmitter accepts operations over a channel. It is responsible for
/// executing the right strategy to deliver those messages to the destination
/// chain. It is designed to be used in a scenario allowing only one
/// simultaneously in-flight submission, a consequence imposed by strictly
/// ordered nonces at the target chain combined with a hesitancy to
/// speculatively batch > 1 messages with a sequence of nonces, which entails
/// harder to manage error recovery, could lead to head of line blocking, etc.
///
/// The single transaction execution slot is (likely) a bottlenecked resource
/// under steady state traffic, so the SerialSubmitter implemented in this file
/// carefully schedules work items onto the constrained
/// resource (transaction execution slot) according to a policy that
/// incorporates both user-visible metrics and message operation readiness
/// checks.
///
/// Operations which failed processing due to a retriable error are also
/// retained within the SerialSubmitter, and will eventually be retried
/// according to our prioritization rule.
///
/// Finally, the SerialSubmitter ensures that message delivery is robust to
/// destination chain reorgs prior to committing delivery status to
/// HyperlaneRocksDB.
///
///
/// Objectives
/// ----------
///
/// A few primary objectives determine the structure of this scheduler:
///
/// 1. Progress for well-behaved applications should not be inhibited by
/// delivery of messages for which we have evidence of possible issues
/// (i.e., that we have already tried and failed to deliver them, and have
/// retained them for retry). So we should attempt processing operations
/// (num_retries=0) before ones that have been failing for a
/// while (num_retries>0)
///
/// 2. Operations should be executed in in-order, i.e. if op_a was sent on
/// source chain prior to op_b, and they're both destined for the same
/// destination chain and are otherwise eligible, we should try to deliver op_a
/// before op_b, all else equal. This is because we expect applications may
/// prefer this even if they do not strictly rely on it for correctness.
///
/// 3. Be [work-conserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-conserving_scheduler) w.r.t.
/// the single execution slot, i.e. so long as there is at least one message
/// eligible for submission, we should be working on it within reason. This
/// must be balanced with the cost of making RPCs that will almost certainly
/// fail and potentially block new messages from being sent immediately.
